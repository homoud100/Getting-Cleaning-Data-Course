Getting-Cleaning-Data-Course
============================
This project has one final script named run_analysis.R which analysis the data set and comes up with a new tidy data with all averages of each subject in each activity.
So, since we have 30 subjects and 6 activities the we will have 180 statuses (or colomns).

To run this script perfectly, you must have the source six files in located at the same directory of the script, which are:
1. subject_train.txt
2. x_train.txt
3. y_train.txt
4. subject_test.txt
5. x_test.txt
6. y_test.txt

whith the smae names as above. 
Then you only need to set the work directory and run the script.

Good Luck,
